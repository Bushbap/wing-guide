  <h2>Welcome to Wing Guide!</h2>
  <p>Our idea is to collect information. Information from birders that are scattered around the globe. We often interact with birds, we get a hint of their daily routines. But we do not know what they get up too, what they eat and how they ineract
    with their own species or even other species.</p>
